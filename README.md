# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis – Temperature & Pressure Trends  

## 📌 Introduction  

This project explores **historical weather data** to analyze **temperature** and **pressure** trends over time. By cleaning and preparing the dataset with Python, analyzing it with SQL, and building **interactive Power BI dashboards**, I gained hands-on experience in:  

- 🔹 Data cleaning & preparation  
- 🔹 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- 🔹 Storytelling through data visualization  

The main questions explored were:  

- 🌡️ How does **temperature** change over time?  
- ⏳ What are the **patterns in pressure**?  
- 📊 How can **Power BI dashboards** reveal hidden insights?

## 📂 Background  

I used a **real-world weather dataset** as a learning project to improve my data analysis and visualization skills. The workflow followed these steps:  

1. Clean raw data with **Python (pandas, NumPy)**  
2. Explore and query the dataset using **SQL**  
3. Export a cleaned dataset for visualization  
4. Build **interactive dashboards in Power BI**

## Dashboards
### Temperature Trends
- Temperature fluctuated between 2006–2016.
- Sharp decline in 2010 (lowest point).
- Peak in 2014 (highest temperature).
- Gradual decline after 2014.
